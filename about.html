								Hello, my name is Ellannah Raftery. I am 26 years old living in Galway, Ireland. In January of 2020 I started my journey into the tech sector by enrolling in the online Software Development course in gmit. After almost two years of hard work, I will graduate and receive a Higher diploma in Software Development. Looking forward I am hoping to launch my career by finding employment as a full stack software developer.

										<h3>Education</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										As mentioned above I have completed a higher diploma in software development in gmit. I’m hoping to graduate in March with a grade of 1.1. Previously to this course I had originally obtained a bachelor’s degree in culinary arts management. I had been working as a chef for 2 years and decided to make a career change. I was very fortunate to have my previous course to use as a steppingstone.

									<h3>Skills and Languages</h3>
									</header>
										<p>
										The main languages I have worked with are Java, HTML, CSS, typescript, JavaScript, MySQL. I have gained experience using the following frameworks, Angular, Ionic, Bootstrap. I am familiar with the Linux and windows operating system as well as computer architecture. A few more subjects I have covered in my college semesters are Network technologies, cloud computing, database design, agile software development and object-oriented programming. Although I have covered a lot in my 2 years with gmit I am always ready to dive into a new language or framework. In the beginning of my career I’d like to build a broad range of technology skills to help pin point what direction I want to continue my career path.

									<h3>Work Experience</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
									My past employment has been retail and hospitality but have given me good skills to bring forward to my new career. Teamwork, time management and customer service are universal strengths I’ve acquired that can be applied to any job. In each of my previous employments I have worked in high demand sectors that involve quality service in short time periods. I have worked throughout the year in these busy environments and have gained the ability to thrive in high pressure moments.
