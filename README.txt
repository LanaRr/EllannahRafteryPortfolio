This is my portfolio to showcase my projects as a software developer.
I used a website template by dopetrope in which i skinned and personalised to suite my needs.
I created a page for each of my 3 projects, a home page and a bio page.
This portfolio is hosted on github pages. 
My linkedIn, Github and Cv are linked in my website. 
Work in progress.
